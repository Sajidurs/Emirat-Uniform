# Project Log — Emirat Uniform WhatsApp Bot

## What this project is
A WhatsApp bot for Emirat Uniform, a UAE uniform company with 13 branches across 7 locations
(Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, RAK, Fujairah). Customers scan a single shared
WhatsApp QR code in-branch, are asked which location and branch they're at, have their
name/phone/branch saved as a lead, and receive that branch's Google My Business review link.
Separately, an admin dashboard lets staff filter leads by branch, send WhatsApp marketing
campaigns using Meta-approved templates, submit new templates for Meta approval, and view
per-campaign delivery statistics (sent, delivered, failed, failure reasons).

## Current status
Project skeleton created (Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind), full Supabase schema,
RLS policies, and seed data written — nothing has been run against a live Supabase project yet,
and no webhook, bot logic, or dashboard code exists yet.

## Architecture
- Next.js App Router + Vercel
- Supabase (Postgres) for data
- Claude API for conversation handling during branch selection only
- WhatsApp Cloud API (Meta) for messaging
- No human handoff, no image handling, no product catalog — this bot is lead capture + review collection + campaign sending only

## Change history

### 2026-08-02 — Initial project skeleton
- What changed: Initialized Next.js project (TypeScript, Tailwind, App Router, no src/ dir).
  Installed @supabase/supabase-js, @supabase/ssr, @anthropic-ai/sdk. Created
  .env.local.example. Wrote supabase/schema.sql (locations, branches, customers, messages,
  templates, campaigns, campaign_sends, with indexes), supabase/rls.sql (RLS enabled on all
  tables, SELECT-only for authenticated, no anon access, write grants revoked at the grant
  layer), and supabase/seed_locations_branches.sql (7 locations, 13 branches, gmb_review_link
  left NULL). Added this PROJECT_LOG.md and a setup README.md.
- Why: Establish the project skeleton and data model before building the WhatsApp webhook,
  bot conversation logic, or admin dashboard.
- Files touched: package.json, .env.local.example, .gitignore, supabase/schema.sql,
  supabase/rls.sql, supabase/seed_locations_branches.sql, PROJECT_LOG.md, README.md

## Known limitations / not yet built
- No WhatsApp webhook (inbound message handling) yet.
- No bot conversation logic (location -> branch -> name -> save lead -> send review link) yet.
- No admin dashboard (lead filtering, campaign sending, template creation/approval submission,
  delivery stats) yet.
- No authentication for the admin dashboard yet.
- gmb_review_link is NULL for all 13 branches — needs to be filled in with real Google My
  Business review links before the bot can send them.
- Schema/RLS/seed SQL have not yet been run against a live Supabase project.
